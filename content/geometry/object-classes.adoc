= Object classes

== Introduction
In ASAM OpenMATERIAL, an object class is a collection of similar objects.
Examples of object classes are vehicles, humans, and road networks.
Each instance of an object class is described by the same properties, but has
individual property values.

The ASAM OpenMATERIAL standard supports the following object classes:

* Vehicle
* Human
* Road and road infrastructure

NOTE: TODO: Add references to dedicated sections describing object classes.

If the human is clearly distinguishable from the vehicle, then both the
human and the vehicle are represented by two different objects. Examples are
bicycles, motorbikes, or scooters, where the human and the vehicle are
perceived as separate entities.

== Class-specific information
Each object class has a specific set of properties, such as:

* Node structure
* Semantic structure
* Animation structure
* Material structure
* Coordinate system
* Pivot points
* Mesh resolution

The interpretation of the following coordinates depends on the class-specific
rules:

* The x/y position represents the center of the bounding box used
to describe the shape of the object.
* The value on the z-axis on the ground represents the default pose.

*Example*
For object class `vehicle`, the z-value defines the pose if a vehicle door is
closed. For object class `human`, the z-value defines the T-pose.

For each object class, the recommended mesh resolution should be used.

NOTE: TODO: Added information on mesh resolution to this section. We should consider
extending the description of the properties above.

NOTE: TODO: Discuss and document
- Class-specific file name conventions
- New or rare structures (for example, front trunk)
- Class-specific levels of detail and impostors

NOTE: TODO: Add information on geometry classes + segmentation?
